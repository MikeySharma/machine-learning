# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains code and notebooks for various machine learning projects I have worked on, primarily using Python. The projects cover a range of machine learning algorithms, statistical models, and exploratory data analysis techniques. Each project folder includes the corresponding datasets (when applicable), as well as documentation for the implemented models and evaluations.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the machine learning projects in this repository, you will need to have Python installed on your local machine along with several packages for data analysis and machine learning.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (if applicable for deep learning projects)

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-projects.git
   cd ml-projects
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Projects

### 1. Logistic Regression
A project showcasing how logistic regression is applied to classification problems. This includes hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and precision-recall tradeoff analysis.

### 2. Decision Trees
An implementation of decision tree models for both classification and regression problems. This project explores pruning, cross-validation, and model evaluation using confusion matrices and accuracy scores.

### 3. Random Forest
A project utilizing the random forest algorithm to improve model performance through ensemble methods. Feature importance is explored, along with hyperparameter tuning for optimization.

### 4. Gradient Descent Optimization
An analysis of different optimization methods (Stochastic Gradient Descent, Mini-batch Gradient Descent) used for training machine learning models like linear and logistic regression.

### 5. Peer-to-Peer Messaging App (Next.js)
An integration of machine learning concepts with web technologies like Next.js for building real-time applications such as peer-to-peer messaging.

Additional projects will be added over time as I continue learning and applying new machine learning techniques.

## Usage

Each project contains a Jupyter Notebook or Python script that can be executed to replicate the results. You can run the projects using:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
or by directly executing the Python scripts:
```bash
python script_name.py
```

Datasets used in these projects are either sourced from publicly available data repositories like Kaggle or generated synthetically for academic purposes. The dataset links or information on how to access them are included in the respective project folders.
